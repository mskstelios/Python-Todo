# Python-Todo
This is a simple To-Do List application built using PyQt5 in Python. It allows users to create, manage, and save To-Do lists with tasks. Lists can be created, tasks can be added, deleted, and the entire list can be saved to a text file. Additionally, users can open and edit existing To-Do lists.
